Fill ratio (or Load factor)
Fill ratio is also known as Load factor. 
This factor determines when to increase the size of HashSet automatically.
For example, for the 1st two constructors the default load factor is 0.75 â€“>
which means after filling 75% of HashSet, new HashSet of bigger size will be created
