Null acceptance:
*********************************************************************
1)For the empty TreeSet as the 1 st element “null” insertion is possible but after inserting
that null if we are trying to insert any other we will get NullPointerException.
2)For the non empty TreeSet if we are trying to insert null then we will get
NullPointerException.
