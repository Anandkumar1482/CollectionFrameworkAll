1)search method is internally will use binarySearch algaritham
2)successful search returns index value and un successful search returns insertion point.
3)insertion point is the location where we can place target elements in the sorting order.
4)before calling binarySearch method compulsary  list should be sorted.otherwise we will get 
predicatable results.
5)if the list is sorted according to the Comparator object at the time of search operation we provide same object for Comparator object otherwise we will get unpredicatble results.
